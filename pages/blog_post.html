    <blockquote cite="https://www.saigontourist.net/">
      Saigontourist was set up just after the end of the Vietnam War to take charge of many of Saigon's hotels and
      restaurants. It diversified somewhat in the 1990s, but mainly remained focused on its core businesses in the
      hotel, tourism, and entertainment sectors, which were growing rapidly. It also developed interests in banking
      and distribution, becoming the leading shareholder in the joint-stock commercial bank Oricom Bank and the
      distributor of Ford in Vietnam. In 1995, Saigontourist was the seventeenth largest company by turnover in Ho
      Chi Minh City.
